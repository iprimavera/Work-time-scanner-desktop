# Work time scanner Desktop version

there's a CLI version of this project [here](https://github.com/iprimavera/Work-time-scanner-CLI)

The program keeps some temporary files in a hidden folder called `.workTimeScanner`
in your home directory. Your main data is automatically saved as CSV files next to the program.

The scanner must be reset if it remains running when the day changes (i.e., if it wasn't closed at the end of the previous day).
